# nbit-sklansky-adder-generator
<h2>python notebook to generate code of n-bit sklansky adder</h2>
known issue:modules / python functions are in random order hence to print code of n-bit sklansky adder run all cells from top to bottom then again start from top and in the end, call to printverilog(n) function will print the verilog code for you
